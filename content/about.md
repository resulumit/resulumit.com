title: "About me"
---

I am a post-doctoral researcher in political science at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch).

My work is mostly about elections and parliaments, using quantitative methods. I am also interested in energy policy and Turkish politics. 

Before joining the University of Lucerne, I was a researcher at the <a href="https://www.ihs.ac.at" target="_blank">Institute for Advanced Studies</a>. During my time there, I also completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/en/" target="_blank">University of Vienna</a>, taught at the <a href="http://webster.ac.at" target="_blank">Webster Vienna University</a>, and held editorial positions.
