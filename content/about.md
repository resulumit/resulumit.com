title: "About me"
---

I am a political scientist, working as an Assistant Professor in Comparative Politics at <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Durham University</a>.

My work focuses on electoral representation, with an additional interest in the politics of energy and climate. I study the behaviour of various actors of electoral representation, such as citizens at elections and their representatives in parliaments. 
Methodologically, I am interested in causal inference with observational and experimental data, textual analysis, and surveys.

I am committed to teaching excellence, having completed <a href="https://www.uio.no/link/english/academic-development/" target="_blank">a training programme in higher education pedagogy</a> and receiving a Fellowship at <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Advance HE</a>.
My teaching portfolio includes graduate and undergraduate courses in political science, covering topics such as research design, quantitative methods, and electoral behaviour. In addition to full-term courses, I develop and deliver workshops on digital research skills for academics.

Before joining Durham University, I was a post-doctoral researcher first at the <a href="https://www.unilu.ch/" target="_blank">University of Lucerne</a> and then at the <a href="https://www.uio.no/" target="_blank">University of Oslo</a>. 

I completed my PhD in 2017 at the <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/" target="_blank">University of Vienna</a>. During my PhD, I was based at the <a href="https://www.ihs.ac.at/" target="_blank">Institute for Advanced Studies</a> in Vienna, which funded my studies.
