I am a political scientist, working as an assistant professor in comparative politics at <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Durham University</a>.

My work focuses on electoral representation, with an additional interest in the politics of energy and climate. study the behaviour of various actors of electoral representation, such as citizens at elections and their representatives in parliaments. Methodologically, I am interested in causal inference with observational and experimental data, textual analysis, and survey methodology.

Before joining Durham University, I was a post-doctoral researcher first at the <a href="https://www.unilu.ch/" target="_blank">University of Lucerne</a> and then at the <a href="https://www.uio.no/" target="_blank">University of Oslo</a>. 

I completed my PhD in 2017 at the <a href="https://www.univie.ac.at/" target="_blank">University of Vienna</a>. During my PhD, I was based at the <a href="https://www.ihs.ac.at/" target="_blank">Institute for Advanced Studies</a> in Vienna, which funded my studies.
