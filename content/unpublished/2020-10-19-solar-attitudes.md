In the fight against climate change, renewable energy has been subsidised in many countries. With the costs passed onto consumers, the governments are paying those, for example, who install domestic solar panels on top of their homes. Drawing on three panel datasets from Germany, UK, and Switzerland, this paper analyses whether installation of these solar panels causes meaningful changes in the householdsâ€™ various political attitudes. Using fixed-effect models as the identification strategy, the paper reports null results---solar installations do not seem to generate political attitudes.
