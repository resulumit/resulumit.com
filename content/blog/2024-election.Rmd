If you're studying UK politics, historical electoral trends, or legislative representation, having access to a comprehensive dataset is invaluable. My latest dataset, *UK House of Commons Election Results at Candidate Level*, offers exactly that—a detailed, candidate-level account of every UK general election since 1832, including the recently concluded 2024 election.


## What’s in the Dataset?

This dataset spans 49 general elections from 1832 to 2024, making it one of the most comprehensive resources on UK election results available. Each entry provides granular data at the **candidate level**, enabling researchers, journalists, and enthusiasts to dive deep into election results, candidate details, and voting patterns over nearly two centuries.

- **Years Covered**: 1832–2024  
- **Elections**: 49 general elections  
- **Level**: Candidate-level data  

The dataset is freely accessible and can be downloaded from [Harvard Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/S83HOA).


## Data Sources and Accuracy

The dataset consolidates information from multiple trusted sources:

- **1832–2019 Elections**: Originally sourced from the now-defunct ElectionHub website. Additional corrections and cross-verifications were made using:
  - Data from the House of Commons
  - Wikipedia entries for individual elections
  - Research by Eggers and Spirling (2014), who compiled historical legislative data.
  
- **2024 Election**: Results sourced from the **House of Commons Library**, specifically Cracknell and Baker’s (2024) official report.  

While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, historical datasets often involve inconsistencies. I welcome feedback and encourage users to report any errors they identify [via email](mailto:resul.umit@durham.ac.uk).


## Why Use This Dataset?

Whether you are an academic researching historical voting trends, a journalist exploring modern election patterns, or a political enthusiast interested in the evolution of democracy, this dataset has applications for a wide range of analyses. Here’s what you can achieve:

1. **Longitudinal Analysis**: Study the shifts in candidate profiles, party dominance, and voter turnout over 192 years.
2. **Historical Comparisons**: Compare electoral trends across time, including significant milestones like the Reform Acts, suffrage expansions, and the rise of new political parties.
3. **Candidate-Level Insights**: Gain detailed insights into the individuals who have contested elections over the years.
