<p>If you’re studying UK politics, historical electoral trends, or legislative representation, having access to a comprehensive dataset is invaluable. My latest dataset, <em>UK House of Commons Election Results at Candidate Level</em>, offers exactly that—a detailed, candidate-level account of every UK general election since 1832, including the recently concluded 2024 election.</p>
<div id="whats-in-the-dataset" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s in the Dataset?</h2>
<p>This dataset spans 49 general elections from 1832 to 2024, making it one of the most comprehensive resources on UK election results available. Each entry provides granular data at the <strong>candidate level</strong>, enabling researchers, journalists, and enthusiasts to dive deep into election results, candidate details, and voting patterns over nearly two centuries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Years Covered</strong>: 1832–2024<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Elections</strong>: 49 general elections<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: Candidate-level data</li>
</ul>
<p>The dataset is freely accessible and can be downloaded from <a href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/S83HOA">Harvard Dataverse</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Sources and Accuracy</h2>
<p>The dataset consolidates information from multiple trusted sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1832–2019 Elections</strong>: Originally sourced from the now-defunct ElectionHub website. Additional corrections and cross-verifications were made using:
<ul>
<li>Data from the House of Commons</li>
<li>Wikipedia entries for individual elections</li>
<li>Research by Eggers and Spirling (2014), who compiled historical legislative data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2024 Election</strong>: Results sourced from the <strong>House of Commons Library</strong>, specifically Cracknell and Baker’s (2024) official report.</li>
</ul>
<p>While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, historical datasets often involve inconsistencies. I welcome feedback and encourage users to report any errors they identify <a href="mailto:resul.umit@durham.ac.uk">via email</a>.</p>
