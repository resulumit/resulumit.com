<p><em>Update (November 2024): Since the publication of this blogpost, Twitter has revised its API access policies, and it is no longer freely accessible in the same way it once was. As a result, some of the workshop slides are now out of date.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://resulumit.com/teaching/twtr_workshop.html" target="_blank"><b>Slides</b></a> | <a href="https://github.com/resulumit/twtr_workshop" target="_blank"><b>All course materials</b></a></strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month, I taught my two-day course on working with Twitter data in R, at the <a href="https://www.unilu.ch/en" target="_blank">University of Lucerne</a>. This was part of a Master’s Programme in Computational Social Science, <a href="https://www.unilu.ch/en/study/study-programmes/masters-degrees/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/lucerne-master-in-computational-social-sciences-lumacss/" target="_blank">LUMACSS</a>.</p>
<p>This course is designed as an introduction to collecting, cleaning, and analysing Twitter data — without having to apply for a developer account. You can find the course material at <a href="https://github.com/resulumit/twtr_workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The slides are better viewed <a href="https://resulumit.com/teaching/twtr_workshop.html" target="_blank">here on my website</a>.*</p>
<p>Once the teaching sessions are over, I guide those interested in using Twitter data for academic research to write a strong application for <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research" target="_blank">Academic Research access</a>, which removes many of Twitter’s strict restrictions on how much data is otherwise available to download, how quickly, how frequently, and how far dating back.</p>
<p>I would be happy to organise this course again. <a href="mailto:resuluy@uio.no?subject=Twitter workshop">Let me know</a> if this might be possible at your institution.</p>
<p>And if you like the sound of this course, you might also be interested in the other digital-skills courses that I teach. Have a look at the <a href="https://resulumit.com/teaching/">teaching section</a> of my website.</p>
