<p>My writing workflow has been based on R Markdown for some time. In March 2020, I organised a workshop at <a href="https://www.campus-luzern.ch/">Campus Luzern</a>, to share my experience with researchers from the three universities in the Swiss Canton of Lucerne. It went very well.</p>
<p>Since then I have revised the workshop material, which you can find at <a href="https://github.com/resulumit/rmd_workshop" class="uri">https://github.com/resulumit/rmd_workshop</a>. The slides are better viewed at <a href="https://resulumit.com/teaching/rmd_workshop.html" class="uri">https://resulumit.com/teaching/rmd_workshop.html</a>.</p>
<p>I would be happy if other instructors used my material for teaching. I would also be happy to delvier this workshop again at different institutions.</p>
<p>My next workshop is again at Campus Luzern, this time on creating academic websites with Blogdown. I look forward to it.</p>
