<p>R Markdown has been at the centre of my research workflow for some time. It allows me to tidy and analyse data, create tables and figures, manage citations and references, and write up the results in one screen.</p>
<p>And if, say, a regression table needs a new model, it often takes only a few lines of code and a click to reproduce the output â€” be it a PDF, HTML, and/or a Word document.</p>
<p>In March 2020, I organised a full-day workshop at <a href="https://www.campus-luzern.ch/" target="_blank"><b>Campus Luzern</b></a>, to share my experience with researchers from the three universities in the Swiss Canton of Lucerne. It went very well.</p>
<p>Since then I have revised the workshop material, which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/resulumit/rmd_workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The slides are better viewed <a href="https://resulumit.com/teaching/rmd_workshop.html" target="_blank">here on my website</a>.*</p>
<p>I would be happy to organise this workshop again. <a href="mailto:resuluy@uio.no?subject=R Markdown workshop">Let me know</a> if this might be possible at your institution.</p>
