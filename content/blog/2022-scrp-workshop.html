<p>I recently organised a short course on web scraping in R, as part of a Masterâ€™s Programme in Computational Social Science, at the <a href="https://www.unilu.ch/en" target="_blank">University of Lucerne</a>.</p>
<p>I have built a <a href="https://luzpar.netlify.app/" target="_blank">website</a> and a <a href="https://resulumit.shinyapps.io/luzpar/" target="_blank">Shiny app</a> just for this course, to facilitate learning. These are tailored for the exercises in the course.</p>
<p>You can find other course material at <a href="https://github.com/resulumit/scrp_workshop" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The slides are better viewed <a href="https://resulumit.com/teaching/scrp_workshop.html" target="_blank">here on my website</a>.*</p>
<p>I would be happy to organise this course again. <a href="mailto:resuluy@uio.no?subject=Web scraping workshop">Let me know</a> if this might be possible at your institution.</p>
<p>And if you like the sound of this course, you might also be interested in the other digital-skills courses that I teach. Have a look at the <a href="https://resulumit.com/teaching/">teaching section</a> of my website.</p>
