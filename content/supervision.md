I am available to supervise PhD dissertations, and welcome inquiries from prospective students about supervision. 
If you would like to discuss potential research projects and supervision opportunities, 
please do [reach out via email](mailto:resul.umit@durham.ac.uk). 
I would be happy to hear from you, and you can expect a prompt reply.

I am currently supervising one PhD dissertation and mentoring another PhD student.
