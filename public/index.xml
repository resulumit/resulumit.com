      <title>The role of income in energy efficiency and curtailment behaviours: Findings from the European Social Survey</title>

      <description>Reducing consumers&amp;rsquo; demand for energy is on the agenda of various energy and climate policies. Although these policies are increasingly internationalised in Europe, our understanding of consumers&amp;rsquo; energy saving behaviour remains fragmented with often contradicting findings from single case studies. Drawing on the latest round of the European Social Survey across 22 countries (n = 41,830), we find that many variables have the same relationship with different energy saving behaviours, except household income.</description>

      <title>Attitudes to carbon taxes across Europe: The role of perceived uncertainty and self-interest</title>

      <description>Climate change policy is a challenging field for many governments committed to the national goals stipulated under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Policies that can be effective often prove too unpopular among the public to put in practice. Does the choice of policy instrument—i.e. taxes versus subsidies—relate to this problem, and if so, how? We tackle these questions with data from a cross-national survey in 23 countries. The results point to a widespread aversion to carbon taxes, especially so relative to subsidies promoting renewable energies.</description>

      <title>National context is a key determinant of energy security concerns across Europe</title>

      <description>Energy security is an important policy goal for most countries. Here, we show that cross-country differences in concern about energy security across Israel and 22 countries in Europe are explained by energy-specific and general national contextual indi- cators, over-and-above individual-level factors that reflect population demographics. Specifically, public concerns about import dependency and affordability reflect the specific energy context within countries, such as dependency on energy imports and electricity costs, while higher concerns about the affordability, vulnerability and reliability of energy are associated with higher fossil fuel consumption.</description>

      <title>EU press releases differ from their reports on Turkey</title>

      <description>The European Commission publishes annual reports on the progress of EU candidate countries, accompanied by short press releases. I find noticeable differences between these reports and releases on Turkey; while the sentiments in the reports have been fairly stable over the years, the press releases often remarkably diverge from the reports.
The Commission’s latest report on Turkey hit the headlines as the worst EU scorecard so far.
To see if there is evidence for this claim, I analysed the sentiments in the EU reports on Turkey since 2005—the year the accession negotiations started.</description>

      <title>Calculating standard deviations for survey subgroups in R</title>

      <description>If you work with survey data in R, you would already know how useful the package survey is.
Among its many other uses, the survey package can compute summary statistics by subgroups. For example, if you have survey of individuals from several countries with an item on the respondents’ income, you can calculate the average income in each subgroup with the svyby() function.
However, like many other functions in the package, svyby() returns standard errors—but not standard deviations—of the mean values.</description>

      <description>When Dogan Media was bought by a pro-Erdogan businessman, many suspected a change in the position of its news outlets in the long-run. I compare the tweets by Hurriyet — Dogan’s top-selling daily — in two presidential elections, before and after the sale. I find unmistakable changes in the way the newspaper approached the candidates, increasing its bias towards Erdogan in the election months after the sale.
Most news media are divided into pro- and anti-Erdogan camps in Turkey.</description>

      <title>Saboteurs in the house: Divergent preferences and legislative speeches on Brexit</title>

      <description>How do legislators deal with having preferences that go against those of the principals that they represent in parliament? This article analyses the debate in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in the House of Commons to explore the relationship between divergent preferences and legislative speeches. It finds that legislators who defy the will of their country or constituency are rather communicative, and their speeches reveal higher levels of negativity. In contrast, those defying their party refrain from speaking in parliament, but if they speak, they use a significantly less negative language.</description>

      <description>Mayor of Istanbul suggested that he would invest more in the districts where AKP voters live. I analysed his investment plan for 2018, and found strong evidence that he means it: the districts governed by AKP receive on average around 250 million ₺ more from the city. Statistical tests point to a partisan motivation behind this difference in public investment.
Last week, Mayor Mevlut Uysal suggested that his administration prioritises serving the voters of Erdogan’s party (AKP), stating that the new metro lines will go to the districts where their voters live.</description>

      <title>Explaining MPs’ communication to their constituents: Evidence from the UK House of Commons</title>

      <description>Everyone agrees that members of parliaments (MPs) should keep in touch with the people they represent. Yet some MPs invest more in communication with their constituency than others. We approach this problem with data from the parliamentary communication allowance in the United Kingdom, where all MPs had the same amount of budget to reach out proactively to their electors. We base our analysis on two fundamental assumptions: that re-election is the main goal of legislators and that communication to signal trustworthiness is one way of securing their re- election.</description>

      <title>Rallies around the flag-draped coffins: The electoral effects of security force casualties in terror attacks</title>

      <description>Security forces have recently become the main target of political violence. I examine a natural experiment in Turkey to understand the effect of their casualties on vote choice. Between two general elections in 2015, Turkey experienced a series of attacks that killed 157 members of the security forces. Based on an exogenous variation of their hometowns across the country, I estimate that the government vote share increases in the burial places of terror victims.</description>

      <title>Communication without legislation? A cross-national field experiment on members of parliament</title>

      <description>Do legislators communicate with constituents about affairs that they cannot legislate? An influential literature underlines the communication of what legislators do in the legislature to their constituents. This article questions the hypothetical link between communication and legislation. I conduct a cross-national field experiment on members of national parliaments (MPs) to investigate how they behave when ordinary citizens require them to explain what they cannot legislate. Overall, the results show that MPs are evenly responsive to explanation requests within and outside their legislative competence.</description>

      <title>With happiness and glory, from your MP: The use of e-newsletters in the UK parliaments</title>

      <description>This article extends the empirical evidence for the use of e-newsletters in parliamentary communication in between elections. It assesses the effect of electoral incentives and parliamentary institutions on members (MPs1) from all four legislatures in the UK. I find that electoral incentives to cultivate a personal vote increase the e-newsletter usage by MPs. However, being an MP in subnational parliaments or smaller parties decreases it. These findings throw a fresh light on why only some parliamentarians are happy to adopt new and seemingly resource-efficient ways to reach out to voters.</description>

      <description>An influential literature underlines how much parliamentary communication of European Union (EU) affairs could offer to democracy in the EU. Yet members of parliaments (MPs) seem unmoved by their potential. MPs are strategic about their communication, and this study questions the suitability of EU affairs to their re-election strategies. Analysing the messages posted on Twitter by regional and national MPs from Ireland and the United Kingdom over a four-month period, this article shows that clear electoral safety and strong political responsibility increase the communication of EU affairs.</description>

      <description>The 2016 Austrian presidential election was remarkably different than the previous ones in the history of the country characterized by its stable political system. Not only did it open the role of president in Austria to debate, but it also sidelined the two political parties that had dominated Austrian politics since World War II. Alexander Van der Bellen won the election with one of the closest margins in recent history. This article argues that the election divided the country in more than one way.</description>

      <description>Many studies have examined the determinants of ministerial selection. However, the effect of electoral incentives on government post allocation has so far not been studied in the literature. Drawing on data from the United Kingdom over the period 1992–2015, this article investigates the relationship between the selection of ministers and the electoral interests of the actors in this selection process&amp;ndash;party leaders and members of parliament (MPs). The findings demonstrate that the greater the electoral safety of constituencies, the more likely are MPs to have a higher office.</description>

With the 1 November 2015 elections—the first repeat elections in the history of the Republic of Turkey&amp;mdash;the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) has regained its parliamentary majority and guaranteed to rule the country for four more years.</description>

      <description>The election of the 12th President of Turkey was remarkably different than the elections of the previous 11. For the first time in the history of the Republic, the head of the state was directly elected by ordinary people rather than chosen by their representatives in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. On 10 August 2014, the incumbent Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan won a simple majority of votes in the first round of the election and became the president for the next five years.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Media Research 3rd year undergraduate course at the Webster Vienna University.
Course description
What makes fake news so popular? How do some advertisements appear to be more memorable than others? Why do some politicians embrace social media while others completely turn away from it? Some of the most interesting questions of our time require systematic analyses of the media. This course did not only introduce students to discussions of the contemporary mass media research but it also helped them develop a research project.</description>
