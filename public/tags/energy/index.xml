      <description>Reducing consumers&amp;rsquo; demand for energy is on the agenda of various energy and climate policies. Although these policies are increasingly internationalised in Europe, our understanding of consumers&amp;rsquo; energy saving behaviour remains fragmented with often contradicting findings from single case studies. Drawing on the latest round of the European Social Survey across 22 countries (n = 41,830), we find that many variables have the same relationship with different energy saving behaviours, except household income.</description>

      <description>Climate change policy is a challenging field for many governments committed to the national goals stipulated under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Policies that can be effective often prove too unpopular among the public to put in practice. Does the choice of policy instrument—i.e. taxes versus subsidies—relate to this problem, and if so, how? We tackle these questions with data from a cross-national survey in 23 countries. The results point to a widespread aversion to carbon taxes, especially so relative to subsidies promoting renewable energies.</description>

      <title>National context is a key determinant of energy security concerns across Europe</title>

      <description>Energy security is an important policy goal for most countries. Here, we show that cross-country differences in concern about energy security across Israel and 22 countries in Europe are explained by energy-specific and general national contextual indi- cators, over-and-above individual-level factors that reflect population demographics. Specifically, public concerns about import dependency and affordability reflect the specific energy context within countries, such as dependency on energy imports and electricity costs, while higher concerns about the affordability, vulnerability and reliability of energy are associated with higher fossil fuel consumption.</description>
