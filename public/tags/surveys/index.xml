      <description>Reducing consumers&amp;rsquo; demand for energy is on the agenda of various energy and climate policies. Although these policies are increasingly internationalised in Europe, our understanding of consumers&amp;rsquo; energy saving behaviour remains fragmented with often contradicting findings from single case studies. Drawing on the latest round of the European Social Survey across 22 countries (n = 41,830), we find that many variables have the same relationship with different energy saving behaviours, except household income.</description>

      <description>Climate change policy is a challenging field for many governments committed to the national goals stipulated under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Policies that can be effective often prove too unpopular among the public to put in practice. Does the choice of policy instrument—i.e. taxes versus subsidies—relate to this problem, and if so, how? We tackle these questions with data from a cross-national survey in 23 countries. The results point to a widespread aversion to carbon taxes, especially so relative to subsidies promoting renewable energies.</description>
