      <description>With Lucy Kinski, we are organising a new online seminar series on political representation: 𝙍𝙚:𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀!
The series aspires to facilitate an inclusive, supportive, and dynamic environment in which scholarly work on anything representation can be presented and discussed.
Each online seminar will consist of a 30-minute presentation, followed by meaningful opportunities for the audience to be involved in the discussion.
You can propose a presentation and register for events on the website of the series.</description>

      <title>Internal links in xaringan presentations</title>

      <description>I am currently revising the slides for the next iteration of my workshop on writing reproducible research papers with R Markdown. It will take place at Campus Luzern, over two full days in November 2020.
There are now over 200 slides in the presentation, and I thought it is now past time to introduce some internal links to facilitate navigation across the different parts of the presentation, which is written with xaringan.</description>

      <description>This post introduces LikeWise — a Shiny app that retrieves and filters users’ likes on Twitter. If you are looking for a quick direction, click here for the app.
I use Twitter likes as bookmarks, but then struggle to find the one that I need among them all. Hence I have built an app. It is live at https://resulumit.shinyapps.io/likewise/. It can be used here as well, in the window below.</description>

      <description>This post introduces psjournals — a new dataset on political science journals as well as an R package and a Shiny app that accompany the dataset. If you are looking for quick directions, click here for the package, here for the app.
Some might find this dataset useful for teaching, if not for research. However, many are likely to use psjournals for selection purposes — to see where they can submit their manuscript for consideration.</description>

      <title>R Markdown workshop</title>

      <description>Click here for the slides, here for all workshop materials.
My writing workflow has been based on R Markdown for some time. In March 2020, I organised a full-day workshop at Campus Luzern, to share my experience with researchers from the three universities in the Swiss Canton of Lucerne. It went very well.
Since then I have revised the workshop material, which you can find at GitHub. The slides are better viewed here at my website.</description>

      <title>Google Scholar ranking of political science journals</title>

      <description>This blogpost has led to an app that filters data on political science journals, including the journal indexes covered here. Try it out at https://resulumit.shinyapps.io/psjournals.
Here is a list of all political science journals in the Social Science Citations Index (SSCI),* ranked according to their h5-index on Google Scholar.
Google Scholar provides a similar list of top journals in political science, but this includes only the top 20 journals.</description>

      <description>I have created a list of open access journals in political science—journals that make all of their articles freely accessible without delay.
Please bear in mind that this is not an exhaustive list and that editorial policies change. If you notice that one or more journals are missing or that one or more existing entries need updating, please send me an email. I would be happy to hear from you.</description>

      <title>Research notes in political science journals</title>

      <description>This blogpost has led to an app that filters data on political science journals, including article types. Try it out at https://resulumit.shinyapps.io/psjournals.
In addition to ‘regular’ articles, some political science journals publish shorter manuscripts as well. They are often called research notes, but the name, and indeed the format itself, can differ from one journal to another. Yet, this definition, by Public Opinion Quarterly, covers a lot of common ground:</description>

      <title>Calculating standard deviations for survey subgroups in R</title>

      <description>The survey package is one of my favourites in R.
Among its many other uses, it can compute summary statistics by subgroups. For example, if you have a survey of individuals from several countries with an item on the respondents’ income, you can calculate the average income in each subgroup with the svyby() function.
However, like many other functions in the package, svyby() returns standard errors—but not standard deviations—of the mean values.</description>

      <title>EU press releases differ from their reports on Turkey</title>

      <description>The European Commission publishes annual reports on the progress of EU candidate countries, accompanied by short press releases. I find noticeable differences between these reports and releases on Turkey; while the sentiments in the reports have been fairly stable over the years, the press releases often remarkably diverge from the reports.
The Commission’s latest report on Turkey hit the headlines as the worst EU scorecard so far.
To see if there is evidence for this claim, I analysed the sentiments in the EU reports on Turkey since 2005—the year the accession negotiations started.</description>

      <title>Media coverage of presidential candidates in Turkey</title>

      <description>When Dogan Media was bought by a pro-Erdogan businessman, many suspected a change in the position of its news outlets in the long-run. I compare the tweets by Hurriyet — Dogan’s top-selling daily — in two presidential elections, before and after the sale. I find unmistakable changes in the way the newspaper approached the candidates, increasing its bias towards Erdogan in the election months after the sale.
Most news media are divided into pro- and anti-Erdogan camps in Turkey.</description>

      <title>Istanbul puts the money where AKP voters are</title>

      <description>Mayor of Istanbul suggested that he would invest more in the districts where AKP voters live. I analysed his investment plan for 2018, and found strong evidence that he means it: the districts governed by AKP receive on average around 250 million ₺ more from the city. Statistical tests point to a partisan motivation behind this difference in public investment.
Last week, Mayor Mevlut Uysal suggested that his administration prioritises serving the voters of Erdogan’s party (AKP), stating that the new metro lines will go to the districts where their voters live.</description>
