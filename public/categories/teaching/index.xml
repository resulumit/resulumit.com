      <description>My writing workflow has been based on R Markdown for some time. In March 2020, I organised a full-day workshop at Campus Luzern, to share my experience with researchers from the three universities in the Swiss Canton of Lucerne. It went very well.
Since then I have revised the workshop material, which you can find at GitHub. The slides are better viewed here at my website.
I would be happy if other instructors used my material for teaching.</description>
