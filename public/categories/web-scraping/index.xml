      <description>Here is a list of all political science journals in the Social Science Citations Index (SSCI),1 ranked according to their h5-index on Google Scholar.
Google Scholar provides a similar list of top journals in political science, but this includes only the top 20 journals. I was wondering how the list looked below this number.
To see that, I have scraped Google Scholar for the journals in SSCI, with the rvest package in R.</description>
