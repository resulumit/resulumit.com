      <description>This blogpost has led to an app that filters data on political science journals, including article types. Try it out at https://resulumit.shinyapps.io/psjournals.
In addition to ‘regular’ articles, some political science journals publish shorter manuscripts as well. They are often called research notes, but the name, and indeed the format itself, can differ from one journal to another.
