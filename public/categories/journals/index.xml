      <description>In addition to ‘regular’ articles, some political science journals publish shorter manuscripts as well. They are often called research notes, but the name, and indeed the format itself, can differ from one journal to another. Yet, this definition, by Public Opinion Quarterly, covers a lot of common ground:
Research Notes are shorter reports … of single findings, important extensions or replications of previous research, or other major additions to the literature that warrant publication, and which can be communicated effectively without the more extended theoretical development or detailed analysis characteristic of regular articles.</description>
